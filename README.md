# SearchBuddy
Run Google searches with one keystroke.
## Installation
Download `SearchBuddy.exe` to folder of your choice. Create a shortcut to it on your Desktop. Right click shortcut on Desktop, click Properties, then click the "Shortcut key" field and hit your preferred key combination. I use CTRL+SHIFT+Z.
## FAQ

Hit your Escape key.

Delete SearchBuddy.exe from wherever you put it and remove the shortcut from your desktop. Done!
